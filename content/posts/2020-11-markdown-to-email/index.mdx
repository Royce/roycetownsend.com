I got sick of copying content into Mailchimp and fixing the formatting, so I started wondering how hard it would be to turn a markdown file into email friendly HTML and send it using Amazon SES.

MDX and MJML do most of the heavy lifting.

I learn _a bit_ about about the MDX runtime and how remark plugins work. I realised I didn't really understand the interplay between the async/await syntax sugar and Promises.
