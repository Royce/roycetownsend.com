## Lofty Dreams

I wanted to include the UI of [my weather hex map experiment](http://github.com/Royce/weather-hex) on the pages of the blog -- as an alternative to including a screen shot.
This blog is built on Gatsby; the other thing is build with Create-React-App.
It _sounds_ easy right!?

```json
// Reference the other project in packages.json
"dependencies": {
  "weather-hex": "link:../weather-hex"
}
```

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Widget from 'weather-hex/src/App';

// Do something with the widget.
// Here I am exporting it, just to include in a markdown page.
export default () => <Widget />;
```

## Could it be this easy?

Nope. We get this _slightly misleading_ error. "Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component", BUT the RecoilJS hooks in the app ARE being called from inside _function_ components. There are no class components in sight.

    Error: Invalid hook call.
    Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component.
    This could happen for one of the following reasons:

    1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM)
    2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks
    3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app

    See https://reactjs.org/link/invalid-hook-call for tips about how to debug and fix this problem.

## What is going on?

I ruled out "mismatching versions of React", by trying to force the versions of `react` and `react-dom` with [yarn version resolution](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/) (which didn't help) and then just upgrading `react` and `react-dom` to `17.0.1` in both the blog and the app.

Finding a solution was confused by the fact that I was including the widget directly in MDX so sometimes I got errors complaining about a missing `RecoilRoot`. Including the widget in a non-Markdown page ruled out this complication.

Looking in Chrome Dev Tools suggested that I did indeed have more than "one copy of React" and they are the same version. Great! Now what.

## Solutions

A **work-around** is to add a [custom webpack configuration](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/add-custom-webpack-config/) to force all of the references to 'react' or 'react.dom' to the _blogs_ node_modules folder.

Luckily this is easy with Gatsby, _phew_...

```javascript
exports.onCreateWebpackConfig = ({ stage, actions }) => {
  actions.setWebpackConfig({
    resolve: {
      alias: {
        react: require.resolve('./node_modules/react'),
        'react-dom': require.resolve('./node_modules/react-dom'),
      },
    },
  });
};
```

## Alternatives?

Splitting the [app](http://github.com/Royce/weather-hex) into a library and seperate SPA, where the library uses [peerDependencies](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/dependency-types/#toc-peerdependencies) to avoid including a second copy of `react` etc. is possible, and perhaps even recommended -- except that I am not _really_ making a reusable component.

I would rather not, if I can avoid it.

## Things I tried that didn't help.

- Making the blog and app use the same version of `react` may have helped, but it didn't fix the problem.
- Playing around with `yarn link` is not helpful, in this case.
- One of the many Github issues suggested trying [lazy loaded components with MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/mdx/importing-and-using-components/), e.g. `React.Lazy` or `loadable-component`.
