When I am not programming (and am awake) I can be found swing dancing,
DJing swing and blues for dancers, running tabletop role playing games,
rock-climbing, cycling, juggling, fire twirling, playing boardgames,
enjoying music, drinking coffee, or listening to a book.

You could read my [resume](/files/Resume-RoyceTownsend.pdf). I've kept it brief.
